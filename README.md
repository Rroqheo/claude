### Build Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/getAsterisk/claudia.git
   cd claudia
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

   bun run tauri dev
   ```
   
   **For Production Build**
   ```bash
   # Build the application
   bun run tauri build
   
   # The built executable will be in:
   # - Linux: src-tauri/target/release/

   ```
   
   **Universal Binary for macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon)**
   ```bash
   bun run tauri build --target universal-apple-darwin
   ```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **"cargo not found" error**
   - Ensure Rust is installed and `~/.cargo/bin` is in your PATH
   - Run `source ~/.cargo/env` or restart your terminal

2. **Linux: "webkit2gtk not found" error**
   - Install the webkit2gtk development packages listed above
   - On newer Ubuntu versions, you might need `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev`

3. **Windows: "MSVC not found" error**
   - Install Visual Studio Build Tools with C++ support
   - Restart your terminal after installation

4. **"claude command not found" error**
   - Ensure Claude Code CLI is installed and in your PATH
   - Test with `claude --version`

5. **Build fails with "out of memory"**
   - Try building with fewer parallel jobs: `cargo build -j 2`
   - Close other applications to free up RAM

#### Verify Your Build

After building, you can verify the application works:

```bash
# Run the built executable directly
# Linux/macOS
./src-tauri/target/release/claudia

# Windows
./src-tauri/target/release/claudia.exe
```
