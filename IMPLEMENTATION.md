### Core Docker Configuration
- **`Dockerfile`** - Multi-stage production build
- **`Dockerfile.dev`** - Development environment  
- **`docker-compose.yml`** - Container orchestration with profiles
- **`.dockerignore`** - Build context optimization

### GitHub Actions
- **`.github/workflows/docker.yml`** - Docker image builds and registry deployment
- **`.github/workflows/build.yml`** - Multi-platform Tauri binary builds

### Documentation & Tools
- **`DOCKER.md`** - Comprehensive Docker deployment guide
- **`docker-setup.sh`** - Helper script for easy deployment management

### Updated Files
- **`README.md`** - Added Docker deployment instructions
- **`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`** - Updated to use `bun` instead of `npm`

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Docker Configuration

#### Multi-Stage Dockerfile
1. **Builder Stage**: 
   - Ubuntu 22.04 base
   - System dependencies (WebKit, GTK, etc.)
   - Rust and Bun installation
   - Frontend and Rust dependency caching
   - Full application build

2. **Runtime Stage**:
   - Minimal runtime dependencies
   - Binary deployment
   - Non-root user setup

3. **Artifacts Stage**:
   - Extract binaries and packages
   - Used for CI/CD artifact collection

#### Development Environment
- Live reload support
- Volume mounting for source code
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- X11 forwarding for GUI development

### Docker Compose Profiles

- **`dev`**: Full development with Tauri and hot reload
- **`web`**: React frontend only for web development  
- **`gui`**: GUI development with X11 forwarding (Linux)
- **`build`**: Production build environment
- **`artifacts`**: Artifact extraction

### GitHub Actions Integration

#### Docker Workflow
- Multi-platform builds (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- GitHub Container Registry publishing
- Automated versioning and tagging
- Cache optimization for faster builds
- Artifact extraction and release automation

#### Build Workflow  
- Native builds for all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Docker-based Linux builds for additional support
- Automated release creation for tagged versions

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and start development
git clone https://github.com/getAsterisk/claudia.git
cd claudia
./docker-setup.sh dev
```

### Development Workflows
```bash
# Web development (React only)
./docker-setup.sh web

# GUI development (Linux)
./docker-setup.sh gui

# Production build
./docker-setup.sh build

# Extract binaries
./docker-setup.sh artifacts
```

### Registry Images
```bash
# Development image
docker pull ghcr.io/rroqheo/claude:dev-latest

# Production image  
docker pull ghcr.io/rroqheo/claude:latest
```
